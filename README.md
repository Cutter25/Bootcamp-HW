# Repo for Bootcamp Challenge Week 1
This repository is to show changes and edits 
made to the code behind the website for Horiseon Social 
Solution Services , inc.
Within the code you will find changes marked with notes to clarify each change.
I was tasked with updating the code to make it more clear and readable for future engineers. 
Lastly, I was tasked with making the website a litte more accessible to those with disabilities as well.
